# Truss (in active development)

Truss intends to be the design system and component library for UC Santa Cruz websites.

Please note that the visual design of Truss components is dependent on the design choices in the [UCSC 2022 WordPress theme](https://github.com/ucsc/ucsc-2022), which is still in development Consider Truss to be beta in both design and functionality.

Truss contains branded web components built with StencilJS. Truss components use the web components standard so they are cross-browser compatible, and don't require a runtime library to function.
